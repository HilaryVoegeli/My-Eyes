# My Eyes Class Project
## This project uses JavaScript programming to move the eyeballs around the screen as related to where the cursor is located. 

#### To run: clone the repository, drag and drop the HTML file into your browser. Or navigate to the GitHub Page: https://hilaryvoegeli.github.io/My-Eyes/
#### In the future, adding more facial features would make these eyes more realistic and reusable in other projects.
